NAME
    Pod::Webserver::Source - Plugin to Pod::Webserver for Viewing Source
    Code

SYNOPSIS
      use Pod::Webserver;
      use Pod::Webserver::Source; # Add this line to 'podwebserver' CLI.
      Pod::Webserver::httpd();

DESCRIPTION
    This software adds source code viewing support to "Pod::Webserver".
    Optional "Perl::Tidy" support is included. If "Perl::Tidy" has been
    installed, the source code will be formatted using the following
    "Perl::Tidy" arguments: "-html -npod -nnn". You may override these
    arguments by resetting the package variable
    $Pod::Webserver::Source::PERLTIDY_ARGV to a list reference or string
    containing your personal preferences. Your ~/.perltidyrc file will be
    honored in the same way "Perl::Tidy" would honor it. If "Perl::Tidy" is
    not installed source code will be formatted in plain text and prefixed
    with line numbers.

    Viewing the source of a module is simple, just click on the link in the
    header next to the back link called Source.

    Due to the nature of this code it is imperitive that
    "Pod::Webserver::Source" be loaded *after* "Pod::Webserver" as
    demonstrated in the SYNOPSIS.

MODIFY podwebserver
    Here's a Perl-ish way to modify podwebserver as I know it, distributed
    with version 3.02 of "Pod::Webserver".

      perl -pi -e'eof and
        $_ .= "use Pod::Webserver::Source;\n"' `which podwebserver`

SEE ALSO
    Pod::Webserver, "Perl::Tidy", perl.

THANKS
    Much of this code was ripped from various pieces written by Sean Burke
    who did all the hard work. I merely mutilated his code to produce this
    functionality.
